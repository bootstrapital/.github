# Our mission is to _increase the surface area of success_ for founders.
_Our goal is to generate $1B in Profit & Carry Share by 2040_

By enabling the creation of the longtail of software businesses, we will help 1000s of founders and operators produce life changing outcomes.

We'll achieve this by:
* Providing a [Slender Stack](https://slenderstack.com) to shrink time-to-market for bootstrappers, indie hackers, and non-engineering founders alike
* Promoting a go-to-market playbook that prioritizes profit generation from Day 1
* Adding fuel to the fire started by the likes of Indie.VC, Calm Fund, and TinySeed

_We're heads down at the moment building out our Platform's core in order to power our flywheel but you'll be hearing more from us soon._

# Our Vision
